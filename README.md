## Usage Instructions

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Project Structure

The project consists of three main files:

1. *index.html*: This is the main HTML file that contains the basic structure of the page, including the login form elements.
2. *style.css*: This CSS file contains all the styles applied to the page, including the styles for the glass effect.
3. *background.jpg*: This is the background image used to create the glass effect. You can replace this image with another of your preference, as long as the `background-image` property in the `style.css` file is updated correctly.
